map.py
~~~~~~~~~~

This module is for building map for the snake game

The map:
- Contains its structure in a matrix form (see MAP in constants.py)
- Contains a instance of a snake and an instance of a food
- Is in charge of managing collisions, creation of food and giving vision to the snake

Notes:
- Some choices might seems weird in term of conception but I built it with priority for performance
      since the GA is greedy
