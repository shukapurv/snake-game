which is very important for the genetic algorithm

"""
Directions are designed in a way that allows you to add it to a tuple of coordinates
and it will make them "move" in that direction
For example if I have a block in [3,6] and add UP it gives [3,5] which is the block above [3,6]

I define it that way because it is a huge gain of time, list comprehension is way slower
And np.zeros is slower in the long term (read and write time)
Put a 1 anywhere you want a WALL
