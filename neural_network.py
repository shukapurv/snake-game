~~~~~~~~~~

This module is for building a classic dense neural network

Weights and biases are initialized randomly according to a normal distribution
A network can be saved and loaded for later use
The class is build for the snake project so:
- The rendering method is not very modular and is specifi for this project, I'll improve it later
- No backpropagation since we don't need it for the genetic algorithm
