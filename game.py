~~~~~~~~~~

This module defines a game of snake which can be displayed or not, playable or not
It uses Pygame for the display

Todos:
- It would be cool to make it more general in order to have a game of "anything" so
  the Genetic algorithm could run games regardless of what it's playing, I'll work on it
  for later projects
- Rethink the class and be able to save the state of the game
