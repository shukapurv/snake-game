~~~~~~~~~~

This module is for building the snake itself in the snake game

The snake:
- Is on the form of a list, each element for a body block (containing its coordinates)
- Has a head pointing on the first block, a direction and also a neural network (brain)
- Has vision given by the map (Map.scan method)
- Is in charge of moving its blocks, aging, growing by adding a block to the right place
  and makes decision with neural net
- Gives its fitness based on self age and length
